            <h3>AI-Powered Medical Diagnostic System</h3>
            <p>Developed an AI-based diagnostic tool that integrates NLP, CNN and ML to analyze patient symptoms, medical images (MRI, CT) and lab results for disease detection. The system provides real-time diagnostic predictions through a web interface, assisting doctors in improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing errors and supporting<br> under-resourced healthcare settings. Built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras and Crescent with a strong focus on data privacy and security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>AI-Music Recommendation</h3>
            <p>Developed a Music Recommendation System that utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest personalized music tracks to users. This project involved collecting and analyzing user data and music attributes to create tailored playlists based on user preferences and listening history.
                <br>Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system improved its recommendations over time, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.</p>
